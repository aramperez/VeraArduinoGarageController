Vera-Arduino Garage Controller
==============================
This project contains the schematics and source code for an Arduino-based garage controller that interfaces to a Vera
2 home automation device from MiCasaVerde. I have not tested it with a VeraLite or a Vera 3.

The controller allows the Vera to query the status of the garage door, to control the garage door (open/partially
open/close) and to control four relays that can be hooked up to irrigation valves.
