Vera-Arduino Garage Controller
==============================
This project contains the schematics and source code for an Arduino-based garage controller that interfaces to a Vera 2 home automation device from MiCasaVerde. I believe the code will work with a VeraLite or a Vera 3, but I have not tested it.

The controller allows the Vera to query the status of the garage door, to control the garage door (open/partially
open/close) and to control three relays that can be hooked up to irrigation valves.
